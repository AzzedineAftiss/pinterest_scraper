# pinterest-scraper
This project aims to extract data from Pinterest such as pin URL, username, user URL profile, number of followers the user has, number of users he follows, and pin image.      

First of all, the bot will log you in with a username and password (you have to edit that in middleware.py), starts scraping all the data about that user you are logged in with, and exports the data in a CSV file as well as pins images.
